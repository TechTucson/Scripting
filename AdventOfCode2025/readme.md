This is my first year trying this challenge. By no means am I a programmer, but I have dabbled in scripting. Basic scripts. I realize I probably won't come up with the solutions myself, so I plan to take others' solutions and learn from those ways. I will add output and comments to the code so that it can be easily understood, initially at least by me, what the logic of the application is doing.
